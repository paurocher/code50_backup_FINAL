Game where a zone starts with some bacteria that grows little y little.
You have a bucket to fill of bacteria and put it into milk to make cheese.

When the cheese is cooked (has enough bacteria) the game stops, a farmer takes a wheel of cheese out of the screen.

Levels are always the same but bacteria growth is faster.
Maybe think about making different types of cheese. Each one can give you extra points or powers to decrease bacteria.
